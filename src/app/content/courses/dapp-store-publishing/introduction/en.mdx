# Publishing and Best Practices

Mobile distribution requires gatekeepers. Unlike web deployment where you control the server, mobile apps pass through approval processes controlled by Apple and Google. These platforms enforce policies on what can run on "their" devices.

Crypto apps face specific constraints. You handle real money, implement self-custody, and enable transactions that bypass platform payment systems. Apple and Google both charge 15-30% fees on digital goods sold through their ecosystems. Crypto apps let users transact directly, avoiding these fees entirely. This creates policy friction beyond typical app review concerns.

<ArticleSection name="The Distribution Landscape" id="the-distribution-landscape" level="h2" />

You have three primary distribution channels for a Solana mobile app:

### Google Play Store

The dominant Android distribution platform. Roughly 3 billion active Android devices run through Play Store as their primary app source.

Google Play provides massive reach and established user trust with built-in payment infrastructure. The platform charges a 30% fee on digital goods, though this doesn't apply to crypto transactions. Crypto apps face restrictions on certain features, and policy changes can affect already-approved apps retroactively.

### Apple App Store

The only legitimate distribution channel for iOS apps. Apple's walled garden gives them complete control over what runs on iPhone and iPad.

Apple App Store provides access to a high-value user base with a strong security reputation and users comfortable with paid apps. Crypto apps face even stricter policies than on Google Play. Wallet apps must come from registered organizations rather than individuals. In-app purchase requirements often conflict with token economics. Sideloading is prohibited except in limited EU markets.

### Solana dApp Store

An alternative app store designed specifically for Solana applications. Runs on Android devices.

The Solana dApp Store has no anti-crypto bias in policies and uses on-chain publishing with an NFT-based app registry. Developers maintain a direct relationship with users without the 30% platform tax, with potential for community governance. The tradeoffs: a smaller user base requiring manual dApp Store installation, Android-only support, and less discovery reach than mainstream stores.

<ArticleSection name="App Store Policy Constraints" id="app-store-policy-constraints" level="h2" />

Apple and Google enforce restrictive crypto policies. Understanding these policies helps you navigate them.

App stores charge 15-30% fees on transactions through their payment systems. Crypto apps enable direct developer-to-user payments that bypass these fees. Reward tokens, governance tokens, and NFTs don't fit the in-app purchase model that App Store policies require for digital goods. Users holding their own keys don't depend on platform account recovery systems.

When users lose money in crypto apps, liability questions arise. App stores face regulatory scrutiny and potential lawsuits for apps they distribute. Their policies reflect this liability exposure: requiring organization-level developer accounts for wallet apps, mandating test accounts for review, and restricting certain features that conflict with their guidelines.

Understanding these constraints helps you design your app and its messaging to work within App Store policies.

<ArticleSection name="The Publishing Decision Tree" id="the-publishing-decision-tree" level="h2" />

Your distribution strategy depends on your app's features and your target audience.

### If your app needs iOS users

You have no choice but to work with Apple. This means:
- Registering as an organization (not individual) if your app includes wallet functionality
- Providing test accounts for App Review
- Potentially limiting certain features that conflict with App Store guidelines

### If your app is Android-only and crypto-native

Solana dApp Store becomes attractive:
- Crypto-friendly policies
- No platform fees
- Your users are already comfortable installing apps outside Play Store

### If you need maximum reach on Android

Publish to both Play Store and dApp Store:
- Play Store for discovery and mainstream users
- dApp Store for crypto-native users who want the full experience
- You can even use the same APK with different signing keys

### Hybrid approach

Many successful Solana apps use embedded wallets (like Privy) specifically to work within App Store guidelines. The wallet is invisible to Apple/Google; it's just "authentication" from their perspective. Users who want more control can connect an external wallet via MWA.

<ArticleSection name="What This Course Covers" id="what-this-course-covers" level="h2" />

This course covers:

1. **Solana dApp Store publishing**: The on-chain NFT system, CLI tools, and submission process
2. **App store review strategies**: How to pass Apple and Google review with a crypto app, including test account setup
3. **Mobile security essentials**: Protecting API keys, secure storage, preventing reverse engineering
4. **Production best practices**: Monitoring, updates, and maintaining a live crypto app

You'll learn how to get your app into users' hands across all three distribution channels, and how to keep it there without security incidents or policy violations.

<ArticleSection name="Prerequisites" id="prerequisites" level="h2" />

This course assumes you have a working Solana mobile app. You should have completed:

- **Course 1 (Mobile Wallet Adapter)** or **Course 2 (Embedded Wallets)** - Wallet integration
- **Course 3 (On-Chain Operations)** - Token transfers and transaction building

Course 4 (MWA Deep Dive) is optional but helps if you're debugging connection issues during app review.

### Required Tools

- Android Studio with SDK tools installed
- Node.js 18-21 (the dApp Store CLI has version requirements)
- A funded Solana wallet for minting Publisher and App NFTs (mainnet SOL required)
- Your app's assets: icons (512x512), screenshots, descriptions

If you're also targeting Apple App Store:
- Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- Organization enrollment (not individual) for wallet apps
- Xcode and iOS development environment

The Solana dApp Store is the most crypto-friendly option.
